# Elden-Ring-armor-optimizer

Small script that will retrieve the best possible armor combination in Elden Ring allowing you to maximize your desired attribute. Blazingly fast. Updated before the DLC.

Requires the PuLP library to be used: ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` after that simply run ```python main.py```
