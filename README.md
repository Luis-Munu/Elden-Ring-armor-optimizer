# Elden-Ring-armor-optimizer
Pretty bland script that will retrieve the best possible armor combination for your character given a maximum weight for it and the stat to maximize.

Take into account that the weight that must be used as input is the one that the armor will use, so remove your weapon weight and cap it to 70% of your maximum weight if you want to medium roll.

It takes about 15 minutes to get the best possible armor due to the high amount of possible combinations.
